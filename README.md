# COVID-19 Dataset in Tensorflow 
## Hello, welcome to my notebook, in this notebook  we check the  covid-19 dataset and we will make the Tensorflow machine learning algorithms to find out relationships between people who died and survived the covid virus

# Before starting You should download [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset) from kaggle,  and Try to reading this notebook: [Covid-19-visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaanxtr/covid-19-visualization-and-machine-learning#Conclusion) 


# Everything you need is included in the source code with the description

### This is just a test to know the Tensorflow and know how to use it
